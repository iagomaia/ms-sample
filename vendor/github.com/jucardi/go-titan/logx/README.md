# Logx Logger manager

Logx is a logger manager that facilitates the use of different logger types for different purposes. 
It attempts to provide a common logging interface to interact with all logger implementations

NOTE: Currently logx just wraps the logrus logger, more implementations will be added as well as
additional features such as logger configuration management, global custom formatting, custom writers,
terminal themes, etc
